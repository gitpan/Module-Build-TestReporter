DESCRIPTION
   Shipping test suites with your code is a good thing, as it helps your users
   know that your code works as you expect on your systems and it allows you
   better debugging information if things break in environments where you
   haven't yet tested your code. However, it can be tedious and tricky to
   convince your users to send you the appropriate failure information.

   Module::Build::TestReporter extends and enhances Module::Build to collect
   information on test failures and the Perl environment for users to send to
   you. Rather than walking them through running tests in verbose mode on the
   phone, in IRC, or via e-mail, use this module alongside your usual
   Module::Build build process and it will gather this information in case of
   failure.
